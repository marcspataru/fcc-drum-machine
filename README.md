This is a certification project for [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine).

The project uses React (with hooks, context), Next.js (with CSS modules) and ESLint.

Note: One of the tests will not pass. This is because I am attaching the `keydown` and `keyup` events to the `window` object. They actually work, but the tests say they don't.
